Hello Group,

Last week Aldo and I had the idea to search through the genomes of various octopuses. I sent an invitation to access the project on github, please let me know if you received it.

The idea of the project is to explore how octopuses manage cyanoglobin (the oxygen carrying protein similar to hemoglobin) given that copper ions are often toxic and mutagenic. Since some species of octopuses have had their genomes recently sequenced, we wanted to first locate the genes responsible for cyanoglobin and then start to find some of the other precursors of the protein in the genome. 

Searching on NCBI's protein database [(hemocyanin) AND "mollusks"[porgn:__txid6447]] gave some proteins as our starting targets, which I have recently aligned. The github repo is a little disorganized, but I have posted some of the starting code. 

Please let me know if you have any questions!

~Michael
